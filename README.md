# How this works

## Local setup

This page is generated by the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) static site generator. To generate and serve these pages on your local machine, make sure [Jekyll is installed](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).

Run jekyll in the project's root directory by executing `bundle exec jekyll serve` **or** `./serve.sh`. In your browser, go to http://localhost:4000 to see the generated page.

## Make updates to the online page

Currently, this site is hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). The online version is built automatically using the code pushed to the master branch. Please open a Pull Request for non-minor code or content updates.
